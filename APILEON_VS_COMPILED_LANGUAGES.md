## 💰 **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**

### **Development Costs** (per feature)

#### **Initial Development**
```
Apileon:  $1,000  (1 week junior dev)
Go:       $3,000  (1 week senior dev)
Rust:     $6,000  (2 weeks senior dev)
```

#### **Maintenance** (per year)
```
Apileon:  $2,000  (framework handles complexity)
Go:       $5,000  (manual infrastructure maintenance)
Rust:     $8,000  (complex codebase maintenance)
```

### **Infrastructure Costs** (per month at 10k req/sec)

#### **Cloud Hosting**
```
Apileon:  $50   (1 small container)
Go:       $20   (1 tiny instance)
Rust:     $15   (1 micro instance)
```

#### **5-Year TCO Projection**
```
Apileon:  $15,000 development + $3,000 infrastructure = $18,000
Go:       $30,000 development + $1,200 infrastructure = $31,200

## 🔄 **Migration Strategies**

### **Apileon to Compiled Language**

#### **When to Consider:**
- Consistently hitting performance limits
- Infrastructure costs become significant
- Team has grown and gained expertise

#### **Migration Path:**
```bash
# 1. Profile current Apileon performance
php artisan performance:profile

# 2. Identify bottlenecks
# 3. Rewrite critical paths in Go/Rust
# 4. Keep non-critical services in Apileon
# 5. Gradual migration based on need
```

#### **Hybrid Architecture Example:**
```
Load Balancer
├── Auth Service (Apileon) - Rapid development needed
├── User API (Apileon) - CRUD operations, frequent changes
├── Analytics API (Go) - High throughput required
└── Image Processing (Rust) - CPU intensive
```

### **Compiled Language to Apileon**

#### **When to Consider:**
- Development velocity is too slow
- Team spending too much time on infrastructure
- Need rapid prototyping capability

#### **Migration Benefits:**
- **10x faster** feature development
- **Built-in** security, validation, database
- **Reduced** operational complexity
- **Better** developer experience
