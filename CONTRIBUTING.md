## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Git
- Composer (optional, for full development experience)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Fork the repository**
```bash
# Click the "Fork" button on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/apileon.git
cd apileon
```

2. **Set up the development environment**
```bash
# With Composer (recommended for development)
composer install

# Or without Composer
chmod +x setup-no-composer.sh
./setup-no-composer.sh
```

3. **Create environment configuration**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your development settings
```

4. **Run tests to verify setup**
```bash
# With Composer
composer test

# Without Composer
php test-no-composer.php
```

5. **Start the development server**
```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes
3. Run tests frequently
4. Commit your changes with clear messages
5. Push to your fork
6. Submit a Pull Request
